### Lets talk Languages I use frequently these days

    Bastion of production, but sadly slow and dynamically typed.

### And Languages I use periodically
* [*c++*](languages/cpp.md)
* go :
  For quite a while, I was big on go, until I discovered Rust...
* javascript
* elm
* vex
* osl

### And Languages I am learning at the Moment
* clojure
* groovy - because of jenkins

### And Lanaguages I have used in the past
* c
* lisp - took a class in lisp once and liked it. and I used to hack on emacs
* haskell (luv it. wish i had more time for haskell)
* java
* tcl - only because of Slim
* perl - precursor to python as a production workhorse in vfx
* rsl - renderman shading language
