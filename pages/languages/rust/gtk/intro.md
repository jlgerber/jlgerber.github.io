# gtk-rs

gtk-rs is, of course, the rust bindings for gtk3. They are fairly complete, and are easily the most robust gui toolkit for Rust. There are some things to get used to however, as the underlying implementation is in c, and the api is not particularly Rusty. Specifically, all widgets provide interior mutibility.

# Working with Cairo
Cairo is an open source programming library that provides a vector graphics-based, device-independent API for software developers. It provides primitives for two-dimensional drawing across a number of different back ends. Cairo uses hardware acceleration when available. 

At least according to wikipedia
