There are a number of editors which I have used over the years. I started on VIM, and graduated to EMACS. Along the way, I was quite happy with Nedit, although I never learned the definitive way to pronounce it.  Lately, I have flurted with Pycharm, Webstorm, Clion, Atom, and VSCode (which I luv).

### Emacs

I have finger memories built up around emacs. But it has been quite a while since I have hacked at emacs lisp.

### Vim
I have started playing around with vim again. All of our systems are almost assured to have vim. Even the ones without emacs. And it is a very powerful editor in its own right. Plus, I really like neovim...
